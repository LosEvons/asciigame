List of current features: 
    - Simple arial10x10 graphics
    - Arrow key movement, escape to exit, and RALT + Space to go fullscreen. All implemented through tcod.
    - Player character "@" that can collide with walls "#". Walls have their blocing property set to True. Floors are "."
    - /Rectangle.py just makes a rectangle shape, and can find it's own center and see if it's overlapping with other rectangles.
    - Simple map generation. Creates different size rooms, and 1x1 hallways between them. All implemented in /game_map.py
    - Rudimentary enemy placement. Randomizes amount per. room.
    - Placeholder AI. The enemy just contemplates it's existence.
    - You can kick them in the knickers. Right now it just prints out stuff. Includes a simple turn system.
    - FOV algorithm provided by tcod.
Experiments:
    - Tried to make water. This font is pretty restrictive, so it probably needs to be changed. 
        Didn't have time to flesh out the generation, but came pretty close. Definately a thing to look at.
    - Tried to make circle rooms. Requires a bit more math than I first thought, but should be one of the first new mapgen features.
    - To make biomes, there should be designated areas for different rooms/materials. Tried it today. A rudimentary test proved succesful.

This project is still mainly following tcod guides, but after I finish a little bit more of the scaffholding, it starts to be possible and safe
to start implementing new features and systems.

Started to make a simple combat system with hp, defense and power. Currently it's left in a state, where it should work, but it's waiting
for some simple AI mechanics.

There was a weird issue relating from the get_entity_at_target_location() function either not having the self attribute and/or me calling the function
as Entity instead of player (a specific kind of entity). That was fixed. After that implemented simple combat and pathfinding. Also changed how information is
handled. Instead of individual prints at every step, we create a list of all the events we are interested in, and handle later in one go.
The algorithm used is A*, for which tcod has tools ready to use. 

In the near future i'm going to finish the death mechanics and start working on the UI. Possibly going to look into changing tilesets, but that's a secondary issue.

Going to also try to add some more commentary to the code I wrote yesterday, so I don't forget what it does.

The task list is right now as follows:
    1. Finnish the tutorial (foundation for all common features)
    2. Tweak graphics
    3. Tweak map generation
    4. Start creating (create or adapt a combat system and maybe try generating some quest through AI.)

Note to self: skim the tcod docu at some point, 'cause there seems to be quite a few inconsistencies between what is taught and what is
recommended by the actual devs.

There was a weird issue with the function that determines which keybinds we use in which gamestate. For some reason a simple syntax change fixed it all. Somehow the inventory was
activating every time another UI element did. And everything worked fine, until I implemented the lvlup system, which didn't play ball for some reason.
